# Create or edit apps in PowerApps Studio for web #
Create and edit apps in PowerApps Studio for web, which opens in a browser window on Windows or other platforms.

**Prerequisites**

- [Sign up](signup-for-powerapps.md) for PowerApps.
- Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Internet Explorer 11 on a computer that's running Windows or a Mac.

## Open PowerApps Studio for web ##
1. Sign in to [powerapps.com](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=708209).

1. In the lower-left corner, click or tap **New app**.

PowerApps Studio for web opens in a new tab in your browser, where you can create and edit apps in the same way as you can in PowerApps Studio for Windows.

## Next steps ##
- Automatically generate an app from your data in, for example, [Excel](get-started-create-from-data.md) or [SharePoint](app-from-sharepoint.md).
- Learn how to [add a control and set properties](add-configure-controls.md) that determine how your app appears and behaves.
- Unleash your creativity by [creating an app from scratch](get-started-create-from-blank.md).

## Known limitations ##

1. **Create a connection.**

	To [create a connection](add-manage-connections.md) to a data source that requires service authentication, use [powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com), and then [add the connection](add-data-connection.md) to an app in PowerApps Studio for web.

1. **Edit and save an app locally**.

	For best results, use PowerApps Studio for Windows to edit and save apps locally. In a browser, you can't save changes to a local app, or you must save a new file instead of replacing the file that you opened.

1. **Use signal functions.**

	**[Acceleration and Compass](functions/signals.md)** functions return accurate values in a published app, but those functions return zero values as you create or modify an app in a browser.

1. **Export and import data.**

	You can [export and import data](controls/control-export-import.md) in a published app but not as you create or modify an app in a browser.

1. **Copy a control across two sessions.**

	You can't copy controls from one session of PowerApps Studio for web to another session of PowerApps Studio for web.

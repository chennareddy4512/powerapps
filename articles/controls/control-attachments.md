## Example ##
1. Create an app from data using a SharePoint List as a data source.  Alternatively add a form to your app and set a SharePoint list as its data source.  
1. Select the **Form** control in the tree view on the left hand side.
1. Click on **Data** in the Properties tab in the options panel on the right.
1. Under Fields, enable the **Attachments** field.

  The Attachments field associated with the SharePoint list will appear in the form.

Don't know how to [add and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?.
